## Planning Story

In order to start the Tic tac toe project it was important to take a step back and analyze what I would want from this project. I first needed to establish what I wanted from the application, by writing out my user stories and creating wireframes for the minimum viable product of the application. After creating my user stories and the wireframes I was able to start writing my code. I decided to start with the API interactions through JavaScript so that I could establish the authentication. Next, I worked on the Tic-tac-toe game using a dummy array to represent how I would communicate with the API. After creating the game logic, and the game engine I was able to adapt my code to communicate with the API, to have my plays automatically update in the API. I stumbled on some problems when developping the game, the most noticeable one was to create a new game right after finishing one. My problem-solving strategy consisted of reading error messages, comparing the answer i've obtained to the one I was supposed to, reading my code, rewriting it, and using external resources such as the internet and the teachers.
